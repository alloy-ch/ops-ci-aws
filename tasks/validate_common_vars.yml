  # [NOTE-zw] in rare cases we need to deploy CloudFormation stack, for instances to work with CloudFront with ACM certificate, the
  # resources have to be in `us-east-1`. Therefore, we need a mechanism to store the "home" region, so that we do not have to put the
  # SSM Parameter `/ops-ci/environment` in all the regions we touch. In the standard process, Ansible role `init_workspace` sets the
  # `home_aws_region` to the value of `aws_region`. Normally that is the very first role an Ansible play uses. The role itself does not
  # touch any AWS resources, which makes `init_workspace` the perfect place to copy `aws_region` to `home_aws_region`.
  # If the development standard is followed, the condition below should not be true.
